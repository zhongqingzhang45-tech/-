Stream UTF-8 bytes and read grapheme clusters safely

In UTF-8, a grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more code points that can be rendered as a single character. For example, the Emoji ZWJ Sequences:

```
[...'👨‍🚀']
→ (3) ['👨', '‍', '🚀']
[...'👩‍👩‍👧‍👧']
→ (7) ['👩', '‍', '👩', '‍', '👧', '‍', '👧']
```

Of course, it's not as easy as splitting by ZWJ characters. In complex scripts like Indic languages, where a single character can also be represented by multiple code points:

```
[...'क्षि']
→ (4) ['क', '्', 'ष', 'ि']
```

You may learn more about grapheme clusters in [*Unicode® Standard Annex #29: Unicode Text Segmentation*](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/).

Besides the built-in Intl.Segmenter API, there are a few libraries that can correctly split grapheme clusters from a string, but few of them accept byte streams directly.

Clustr aims to help you iterate grapheme clusters from a stream of UTF-8 bytes, making it easy to read them correctly, safely, and as early as possible.

## Installation

```bash
# if PNPM
pnpm add clustr

# else if NPM
npm install clustr

# else if Yarn
yarn add clustr
```

## Usage

```ts
import { readGraphemeClusters } from 'clustr'

function createStream(text: string) {
  const bytes = new TextEncoder().encode(text)
  let pullIndex = 0

  return new ReadableStream<Uint8Array>({
    pull(controller) {
      if (pullIndex < bytes.length) {
        controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array([bytes[pullIndex++]!]))
      }
      else {
        controller.close()
      }
    },
  })
}

const stream = createStream('👨‍🚀👩‍🚀💇‍♀️🚵‍♂️🚵‍♀️👩‍👩‍👧‍👧')
const reader = stream.getReader()

for await (const cluster of readGraphemeClusters(reader)) {
  console.log(cluster)
}
```

## Use case

Sometimes, you may want the message to appear in a stream-like manner with fancy animations in your chat bubble, like this:

![](docs/airi-chat-bubble.gif)

We built many UI components at [Project AIRI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi), where we use this library to safely split the elements to be animated in the chat bubble shown above. You should definitely check it out if you are also interested in meeting an AI soulmate.
